Ranks Module 1.0

This module will let you see the ranks you have in your VA and show the aircraft contained within those ranks.

If you have installed my codeshare module all you have to do is import the update_strider.sql file

If not, please import the phpvms_strider and edit the RanksData.class.php file on line 33 and change the 8 to a 1.
